Description: KDevelop DragonScript Scripting Language Plugin
 Adds DragonScript support to KDevelop. Supports syntax highlighting
 and code completion.
 .
 No extra packages are required for scripts using only the
 DragonScript language.
 .
 For game development using the Drag[en]gine Game Engine the package
 "libdragengine1" is required since it contains the game engine
 script classes including native class prototypes. If the package
 is not installed projects based on the game engine scripts can
 still be loaded but all the script class information is missing.
 .
 To enable game development open the project settings and go to
 the DragonScript panel. Check the "Requires Drag[en]gine Package"
 check box and reparse the project.
