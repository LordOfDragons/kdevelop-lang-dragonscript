DUChain locking
---------------

It's difficult to find consistent information in the source code or elsewhere when locking
of the DUChain is required and what type of locking is required. So far I figured out this:

- When accessing DUContext method of "const" type DUChainReadLocker is required

- When accessing DUContext method of non-"const" type DUChainWriteLocker is required

- Declaration::owner() does not seem to require locking

- DUChainPointer does not seem to require locking (weak pointer)

- DUChainReferencedPointer requires DUChainWriteLocker since DUContext can be destroyed

- Recurive DUChainReadLocker is not a problem

- Recursive DUChainWriteLocker results in dead-lock

- DUChainWriteLocker while DUChainReadLocker is held results in dead-lock
